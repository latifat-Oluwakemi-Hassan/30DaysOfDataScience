30DaysOfDataScience

## This repository contains Jupyter notebooks documenting my 30 Days of Data Science journey. In particular, it shows how I learned Python step-by-step, including mistakes I made along the way.

# Day 1: Python Basics and Printing
Errors I Made

# Syntax Error:
In one cell, I accidentally added a '|' symbol before a comment, which caused a syntax error.
**Lesson:** Python doesn't allow special characters at the beginning of lines expect '_'

Case Sensitivity Error:
I wrote Print instead of print. Python is case-sensitive, so this caused a 'NameError'.

How I Fixed Them

Removed the stray '|' character to fix the syntax error.

Corrected Print to lowercase print to fix the case sensitivity issue.

## Why Documenting Errors Matters

By showing my mistakes and fixes, I can track my progress and help others understand common beginner issues in Python.
