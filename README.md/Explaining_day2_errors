Error I made

IndentationError: unexpected indent

In cell 3, I put (extra space or tab) at the beginning of a line where it was not expected.
**Lesson** Python is very strict about indentation, which is used to define blocks of code (like inside functions, loops, etc.)

'SyntaxError': invalid syntax

In cell 6, I accidentally added a '|' symbol before "Alice", which caused invalid syntax.
Python means there's something wrong with the way your code is written, and Python can't understand it.

How i fix them
I removed the extra space at the begining of 'name = "Alice".
I removed the special character in front of '|' "Alice".



**I was able to Set up Git for version control and pushed your first changes to GitHub.
